Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This repo is my personal collection of everything Iâ€™ve learned about Robotics.

First of all : Robotics isnâ€™t just humanoid robots. Itâ€™s anything automated from tiny bots to AI systems, from math functions controlling drones to full-blown automated systems.

Right now, Iâ€™m part of a small team that builds bots for college tech events like racing, soccer, sumo, war, etc. Through this repo, Iâ€™ll take you through how we create such bots and maybe even real humanoid bots someday.

Iâ€™ll also cover the basics of electronics and components, because I was once a total beginner too  and understanding the basics is very crucial.
